Hello {EMAIL}!

You've been issued a server code for use use with the PDL Advanced SQL course.
Please use the code below to create and configure a Virtual Machine (VM) for
this course.

Server Code: {SERVER_CODE}

VM Creation Guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vbKJdXfwSeCbhZwaRg_t97D62tR6MSqMiEl5NuvCky4

Please note that there is an extra section at the bottom of this guide named
"CockroachDB (Distribute SQL)". You only need to perform those steps if you
want to try out CockroachDB. They are not required for this PDL class.

Finally, if you have any issues with this code, please reach out to the PDL
team.

Best,
Paul
