- How many flights in 2020?

SELECT count(*)
FROM route_flights
WHERE start_ts >= '2020-01-01'
  AND start_ts < '2021-01-01'


- How many flights in the past year?

SELECT count(*)
FROM route_flights
WHERE start_ts <= now()
  AND start_ts > now() - INTERVAL '1 year'


- What are the highest and lowest mile counts (ie. Tach Time)?

SELECT max(tach_time) as tach_time
FROM aircraft

UNION

SELECT min(tach_time) as tach_time
FROM aircraft;


- What aircraft have the most miles, least? Together?

SELECT a.id, a.tach_time
FROM aircraft a
WHERE a.tach_time in (
    SELECT max(tach_time) as tach_time
    FROM aircraft
    UNION
    SELECT min(tach_time) as tach_time
    FROM aircraft
);


- How many times has each FF# been used?

SELECT p.frequent_flyer_number, count(p.id)
FROM passengers p
WHERE p.frequent_flyer_number IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.frequent_flyer_number
ORDER BY count(p.id) DESC;


- What passengers have flown the most (what if they have very similar names but not quite the same)?
  Doe these number agree with the FF numbers from above?

SELECT
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name,
    count(p.id)
FROM passengers p
GROUP BY p.first_name, p.last_name
HAVING count(p.id) > 1
ORDER BY count(p.id) DESC;


- What is the annual cost due to unsold seats?

SKIPPED


- What Origin Destination combo sells the most?

  Thought plan:
      - I need the table with route information
      - For each route, I need a count of flights
      - For each flight, I need the number of seats sold
      - Order that by most to least

SELECT origin_code, destination_code, count(sa.id)
FROM routes r
LEFT JOIN route_flights rf ON r.id = rf.route_id
LEFT JOIN seat_assignments sa ON rf.id = sa.route_flight_id
GROUP BY origin_code, destination_code
ORDER BY count(sa.id) DESC;

Why not join on ticket table? Loads another unneeded table. Seat assignment is one to one with ticket and all we need is a count of tickets.


- Which Origin -> Dest sells out the soonest?

SKIPPED


- What is the most sold seat?

SELECT count(sa.id), acs.number
FROM seat_assignments sa
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON acs.id = sa.seat_id
GROUP BY acs.number
ORDER BY count(sa.id) DESC;


- What is the most unsold seat?

Can we use the least frequently sold seat? Some seats may never get sold.
Would it show up in our previous query? NO. Left join would not include
"empty" results form aircraft_seat.

Can we flip the JOIN? YEP.

SELECT acs.number, count(sa.id)
FROM aircraft_seat acs
LEFT JOIN seat_assignments sa ON acs.id = sa.seat_id
GROUP BY acs.number
ORDER BY count(sa.id) ASC;

BUT....

What is this question even asking? A40 on one plane is not A40 on another plane,
because other planes may not even have A40. We really need to know what
the seat's "context" is. Ie. Where on the plan is least sold? This is going to
be specific aircraft type, seat class, etc.

SELECT at.manufacturer, at.model, acs.number, count(sa.seat_id)
FROM tickets t
LEFT JOIN seat_assignments sa ON t.seat_assignment_id = sa.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON sa.seat_id = acs.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON acs.aircraft_type_id = at.id
GROUP BY at.manufacturer, at.model, acs.number;

SELECT at.manufacturer, at.model, acs.number, acs.type, acs.location, count(sa.seat_id)
FROM tickets t
LEFT JOIN seat_assignments sa ON t.seat_assignment_id = sa.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON sa.seat_id = acs.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON acs.aircraft_type_id = at.id
GROUP BY at.manufacturer, at.model, acs.number, acs.type, acs.location
ORDER BY count(sa.seat_id);


- What is the most unsold Orig -> Dest

Let start by by looking at seat assignment records for a route flight...
This give us the number of seats sold per route flight

SELECT sa.route_flight_id, count(sa.id)
FROM seat_assignments sa
GROUP BY sa.route_flight_id;

This gives us the total number of seats on the plane.

SELECT count(acs.id) as total
FROM route_flights rf
LEFT JOIN aircraft a ON rf.aircraft_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON a.type_id = at.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON at.id = acs.aircraft_type_id
WHERE rf.id = 2
GROUP BY rf.id;

Can we combine the two? Yep.

SELECT
    count(acs.id) as total,
    (SELECT count(id)
     FROM seat_assignments sa
     WHERE rf.id = sa.route_flight_id) as sold
FROM route_flights rf
LEFT JOIN aircraft a ON rf.aircraft_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON a.type_id = at.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON at.id = acs.aircraft_type_id
WHERE rf.id = 2
GROUP BY rf.id;

Can we get a percentage?

SELECT
    div(
     (SELECT count(id)
      FROM seat_assignments sa
      WHERE rf.id = sa.route_flight_id),
     count(acs.id)
    )
FROM route_flights rf
LEFT JOIN aircraft a ON rf.aircraft_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON a.type_id = at.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON at.id = acs.aircraft_type_id
WHERE rf.id = 2
GROUP BY rf.id;

Why zero?

SELECT
    div(
     (SELECT count(id)
      FROM seat_assignments sa
      WHERE rf.id = sa.route_flight_id),
     count(acs.id)
    )
FROM route_flights rf
LEFT JOIN aircraft a ON rf.aircraft_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON a.type_id = at.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON at.id = acs.aircraft_type_id
WHERE rf.id = 2
GROUP BY rf.id;

Hmmm, maybe its doing integer division? In that case, we need to drop the "div" function too.

SELECT
     (SELECT count(id)
      FROM seat_assignments sa
      WHERE rf.id = sa.route_flight_id) / count(acs.id)::decimal
FROM route_flights rf
LEFT JOIN aircraft a ON rf.aircraft_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON a.type_id = at.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON at.id = acs.aircraft_type_id
WHERE rf.id = 2
GROUP BY rf.id;

Show EXPLAIN.  Add view with this select?

EXPLAIN SELECT
     (SELECT count(id)
      FROM seat_assignments sa
      WHERE rf.id = sa.route_flight_id) / count(acs.id)::decimal
FROM route_flights rf
LEFT JOIN aircraft a ON rf.aircraft_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON a.type_id = at.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON at.id = acs.aircraft_type_id
WHERE rf.id = 2
GROUP BY rf.id;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, COSTS, VERBOSE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON) SELECT
     (SELECT count(id)
      FROM seat_assignments sa
      WHERE rf.id = sa.route_flight_id) / count(acs.id)::decimal
FROM route_flights rf
LEFT JOIN aircraft a ON rf.aircraft_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_types at ON a.type_id = at.id
LEFT JOIN aircraft_seat acs ON at.id = acs.aircraft_type_id
WHERE rf.id = 2
GROUP BY rf.id;
